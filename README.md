IP Lookup

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A list of APIs that I use for my projects.

It has two relevant routes:

"/iplookup" Which returns the data about the requester's IP address and

"/iplookup/?ip=1.1.1.1" With 1.1.1.1 being placeholder data and returns information about the specified IP address.

The API url is: https://infinite-dusk-92659.herokuapp.com/
